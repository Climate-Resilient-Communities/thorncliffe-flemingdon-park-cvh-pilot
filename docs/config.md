# Configuration

Where each setting of the pilot lives, who sets it, and the non-secret values chosen. Secret values
are never written here: only their names and where they are kept. The full rules for each variable
are in `src/platform/config/env.ts`.

## Vercel: Production environment variables

| Variable | Secret | Value or rule | Set |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | the app's connection as `cvh_app_login`, transaction pooler (port 6543) | yes |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | yes | Supabase Auth Admin API and the private directory Storage bucket | yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | no | the Supabase project | yes |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | no | `https://project-6qcs4.vercel.app` | yes |
| `STAFF_PASSWORD_PEPPER` | yes | 32+ random bytes (`openssl rand -hex 32`); never change it once staff exist | 2026-10-02 |
| `SMS_MODE` | no | `live` (production only) | in progress |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | yes | production only; the from-number is the toll-free number in E.164 | in progress |
| `SMS_TEST_ALLOWLIST` | no, but never in the repository | comma-separated E.164 numbers for the S01.15 test text | in progress |
| `EMBED_PUBLISH_ALLOWANCE_CALLS_PER_MONTH` | no | `500` | 2026-10-02 |
| `EMBED_PUBLISH_ALLOWANCE_TOKENS_PER_MONTH` | no | `1000000` | 2026-10-02 |
| `COHERE_API_KEY` | yes | production only, with a spend limit set on the key in Cohere | not yet |
| `SEARCH_THRESHOLD` | no | default `0.3` (provisional until S03.07) | default |
| `SEARCH_EMBED_MODEL` | no | default `embed-v4.0` | default |
| `SEARCH_EMERGENCY_CATEGORIES` | no | default `Support & Emergency Services` | default |

The two `EMBED_PUBLISH_ALLOWANCE_*` variables and the `SEARCH_*` variables take effect once S03.02
(release search data) is deployed. Twilio, `SMS_TEST_ALLOWLIST` and `COHERE_API_KEY` must not be set
in Preview or Development: start-up fails there.

## GitHub: environments

| Environment | Secrets and variables | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `production` | `VERCEL_TOKEN` (replaced 2026-10-02), `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` (as `postgres`, session pooler, port 5432), `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`; variables `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `PRODUCTION_URL` | deploys from `main` only |
| `preview` | `VERCEL_TOKEN` (replaced 2026-10-02), `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` | previews only for branches with an open pull request |

`VERCEL_TOKEN` must be a personal token of a member of the Vercel team that owns the project,
scoped to that team: `vercel promote` and `vercel rollback` look up the token's user and fail with
"User not found (404)" otherwise.

The "Seed production" workflow (Actions tab) runs `seed:providers`, `seed:buildings` or
`seed:guides` with `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL`, in `dry-run` by default.

## Supabase (Auth settings)

- JWT expiry: `43200` seconds (12 hours).
- Password policy and TOTP MFA turned on.

## Twilio

- Toll-free verification and its compliance profile are required before texts from the toll-free
  number are delivered; until then sends fail with error 30032.
